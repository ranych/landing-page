# landing-page
This is my landing page project.

I will be building a website with layouts similar to real working websites. I will be able to utilize CSS and Flexbox in conjunction with HTML to lay out and style the design and look of the webpage.

After working on this project, I can say I learned a lot about how CSS and Flexbox works in conjunction with HTML to create a website with a good layout and styling applied to it.

I definitely had to think through the logic of how to position each section the way I want it to look. For example, I was trying to figure out how to get the captions on the four images under the information header to not overlap with each other. I decided to put a width on it and then try to center it corresponding the image above it while using the figcaption element. By doing this, it ensures the caption is aligned in the center just below the image while there is some space in between the captions.

Being able to learn how to use a Google font was pretty neat since it gives us more options outside of what currently exists in the library for font families.

Overall, I enjoyed being able to play around with CSS and Flexbox to get a better sense of how styling works when applied to the layout that was set with HTML.
